				<h2>Artist Statement</h2>

						<p>Portrait and the human figure play a prominent role in my recent work. I am interested in the long tradition of portraying the human form in art, and the dichotomy of the figure as both universal and deeply individual and personal.  I choose to emphasize the personal element – my paintings and drawings are of specific individuals: myself, my partner, my mother. I aim to portray an enigmatic mood, a sense of isolation and interpersonal distance. In the banality of everyday scenes I hope to communicate elements of the human condition – personally and individually experienced, and universally relatable.</p>
						<p>I work with paint, graphite, and charcoal. Some of my works are on traditional stretched canvas. I also work frequently on paper, a decision that is about the humility of the works and their significance as personal artifacts. It is important to me that the artist’s hand is visible, and that I preserve the gestural lines that are the first instance of mark making in the piece. I frequently start by drawing, move to paint, and then draw again on top. The visibility of line feels honest and transparent about the act of representing an image. It references the endeavor of making a two-dimensional representation of a three-dimensional form. I sometimes engage cutouts and layering of multiple sheets of paper, to further emphasize this interplay. The addition of three-dimensional space adds a sculptural element to the work.</p>

				<p>The style and content of my work has many influences. I found particular inspiration in recent exhibits of Balthus and Hopper, in their content, mood, and style. Their works show figures in space, in everyday and often private scenes, devoid of certain emotive warmth and both deeply relatable and starkly isolating. Since moving to San Francisco in the last year, I have been especially influenced by the Bay Area Figurative artists Elmer Bischoff and Richard Diebenkorn. The rendering of their figures and the interplay between planes and forms influence and inspire my artistic choices.</p>
